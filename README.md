It is a simple android application that Android Fetch Products, Categories, Collections and Shops.



## Architecture
VITRIN uses MVVM [Model-View-ViewModel] architecture to have a unidirectional flow of data, separation of concern, testability, and a lot more and Ä±t uses to HILT
to provide a standard way to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.


## What IS MVVM?

## What Is HILT?
Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project.
Hilt provides a standard way to use DI in your application by providing containers for every Android class in your project and managing their lifecycles automatically. Hilt is built on top of the popular DI library Dagger to benefit from the compile-time correctness, runtime performance, scalability, and Android Studio support that Dagger provides
